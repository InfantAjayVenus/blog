# List of Ideas to Work on

Below is a list of Ideas and it's descriptions respectively, that I'd like to work on at some point.
These Ideas could be related to some project, some workflow improvement etc.,

1. A Focus mode App: This app basically suppresses all notifications and restricts the device to only two possible screens i.e., the dashboard of the App itself and a preconfigured focus mode app, with the focus mode app being the primary screen. This could be device on it's own if needed for education purposes. Such a device could be built with an E-Ink display.

2. An editor for touch screens that brings the editing experience closer to that of modal editor like Vim for a touch device with on-screen keyboard. Reference: [ChatGPT's suggestions](https://chatgpt.com/share/698a5795-e63c-8010-9355-fe16b4d46e27)
